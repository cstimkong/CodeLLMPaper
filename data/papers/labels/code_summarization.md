- [Automatic Semantic Augmentation of Language Model Prompts (for Code Summarization)](../venues/ICSE2024/paper_19.md), ([ICSE2024](../venues/ICSE2024/README.md))

  - **Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLM) are a new class of computation engines, "programmed" via prompt engineering. Researchers are still learning how to best "program" these LLMs to help developers. We start with the intuition that developers tend to consciously and unconsciously collect semantics facts, from the code, while working. Mostly these are shallow, simple facts arising from a quick read. For a function, such facts might include parameter and local variable names, return expressions, simple pre-...

- [Enhancing Vulnerability Detection via Inter-procedural Semantic Completion](../venues/ISSTA2025/paper_11.md), ([ISSTA2025](../venues/ISSTA2025/README.md))

  - **Abstract**: Inspired by advances in deep learning, numerous learning-based approaches for vulnerability detection have emerged, primarily operating at the function level for scalability. However, this design choice has a critical limitation: many vulnerabilities span multiple functions, causing function-level approaches to lose the semantics of called functions and fail to capture true vulnerability patterns. To address this issue, we propose VulnSC, a novel framework designed to enhance learning-based appr...

- [Natural Is the Best: Model-Agnostic Code Simplification for Pre-trained Large Language Models](../venues/FSE2024/paper_17.md), ([FSE2024](../venues/FSE2024/README.md))

  - **Abstract**: Pre-trained Large Language Models (LLM) have achieved remarkable successes in several domains. However, code-oriented LLMs are often heavy in computational complexity, and quadratically with the length of the input code sequence. Toward simplifying the input program of an LLM, the state-of-the-art approach has the strategies to filter the input code tokens based on the attention scores given by the LLM. The decision to simplify the input program should not rely on the attention patterns of an LL...

- [Understanding Code Changes Practically with Small-Scale Language Models](../venues/ASE2024/paper_3.md), ([ASE2024](../venues/ASE2024/README.md))

  - **Abstract**: Recent studies indicate that traditional techniques for understanding code changes are not as effective as techniques that directly prompt language models (LMs). However, current LM-based techniques heavily rely on expensive, large LMs (LLMs) such as GPT-4 and Llama-13b, which are either commercial or prohibitively costly to deploy on a wide scale, thereby restricting their practical applicability. This paper explores the feasibility of deploying small LMs (SLMs) while maintaining comparable or ...
