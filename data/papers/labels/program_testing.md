## General Testing

- [Blended Analysis for Predictive Execution](../venues/FSE2025/paper_40.md), ([FSE2025](../venues/FSE2025/README.md))

  - **Abstract**: Although Large Language Models (LLMs) are highly proficient in understanding source code and descriptive texts, they have limitations in reasoning on dynamic program behaviors, such as execution trace and code coverage prediction, and runtime error prediction, which usually require actual program execution. To advance the ability of LLMs in predicting dynamic behaviors, we leverage the strengths of both approaches, Program Analysis (PA) and LLM, in building PredEx, a predictive executor for Pyth...

  - **Abstract**: This paper presents Tratto, a neuro-symbolic approach that generates assertions (boolean expressions) that can serve as axiomatic oracles, from source code and documentation. The symbolic module of Tratto takes advantage of the grammar of the programming language, the unit under test, and the context of the unit (its class and available APIs) to restrict the search space of the tokens that can be successfully used to generate valid oracles. The neural module of Tratto uses transformers fine-tune...

  - **Abstract**: The ability to execute the test suite of a project is essential in many scenarios, e.g., to assess code quality and code coverage, to validate code changes made by developers or automated tools, and to ensure compatibility with dependencies. Despite its importance, executing the test suite of a project can be challenging in practice because different projects use different programming languages, software ecosystems, build systems, testing frameworks, and other tools. These challenges make it dif...

  - **Abstract**: Many popular programming languages, including C#, Java, and Python, support exceptions. Exceptions are thrown during program execution if an unwanted event happens, e.g., a method is invoked with an illegal argument value. Software developers write exceptional behavior tests (EBTs) to check that their code detects unwanted events and throws appropriate exceptions. Prior research studies have shown the importance of EBTs, but those studies also highlighted that developers put most of their effort...

  - **Abstract**: Search-based software testing (SBST) generates high-coverage test cases for programs under test with a combination of test case generation and mutation. SBST's performance relies on there being a reasonable probability of generating test cases that exercise the core logic of the program under test. Given such test cases, SBST can then explore the space around them to exercise various parts of the program. This paper explores whether Large Language Models (LLMs) of code, such as OpenAI's Codex, c...

  - **Abstract**: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized language processing, but face critical challenges with security, privacy, and generating hallucinations â€” coherent but factually inaccurate outputs. A major issue is fact-conflicting hallucination (FCH), where LLMs produce content contradicting ground truth facts. Addressing FCH is difficult due to two key challenges: 1) Automatically constructing and updating benchmark datasets is hard, as existing methods rely on manually curated static benchmar...

  - **Abstract**: Fuzzing has achieved tremendous success in discovering bugs and vulnerabilities in various software systems. Systems under test (SUTs) that take in programming or formal language as inputs, e.g., compilers, runtime engines, constraint solvers, and software libraries with accessible APIs, are especially important as they are fundamental building blocks of software development. However, existing fuzzers for such systems often target a specific language, and thus cannot be easily applied to other l...

- [Treefix: Enabling Execution with a Tree of Prefixes](../venues/ICSE2025/paper_59.md), ([ICSE2025](../venues/ICSE2025/README.md))

  - **Abstract**: The ability to execute code is a prerequisite for various dynamic program analyses. Learning-guided execution has been proposed as an approach to enable the execution of arbitrary code snippets by letting a neural model predict likely values for any missing variables. Although state-of-the-art learning-guided execution approaches, such as LExecutor, can enable the execution of a relative high amount of code, they are limited to predicting a restricted set of possible values and do not use any fe...

  - **Abstract**: Code debugging is a vital stage of software development, essential for ensuring the reliability and performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in the code generation task. Human debugging typically follows a multi-stage process, which includes Bug Localization, Bug Identification, Code Repair, and Code Recognition. However, existing code debugging benchmarks predominantly focus on the Code Repair stage, which offers only a limited perspective on evaluating the debugging capabilities of LLMs. In...

## Bug Reproduction

- [A Knowledge Enhanced Large Language Model for Bug Localization](../venues/FSE2025/paper_25.md), ([FSE2025](../venues/FSE2025/README.md))

  - **Abstract**: A significant number of bug reports are generated every day as software systems continue to develop. Large Language Models (LLMs) have been used to correlate bug reports with source code to locate bugs automatically. The existing research has shown that LLMs are effective for bug localization and can increase software development efficiency. However, these studies still have two limitations. First, these models fail to capture context information about bug reports and source code. Second, these ...

  - **Abstract**: Runtime failures are commonplace in modern distributed systems. When such issues arise, users often turn to platforms such as Github or JIRA to report them and request assistance. Automatically identifying the root cause of these failures is critical for ensuring high reliability and availability. However, prevailing automatic root cause analysis (RCA) approaches rely significantly on comprehensive runtime monitoring data, which is often not fully available in issue platforms. Recent methods lev...

- [Evaluating Diverse Large Language Models for Automatic and General Bug Reproduction](../venues/TSE2024/paper_13.md), ([TSE2024](../venues/TSE2024/README.md))

  - **Abstract**: Bug reproduction is a critical developer activity that is also challenging to automate, as bug reports are often in natural language and thus can be difficult to transform to test cases consistently. As a result, existing techniques mostly focused on crash bugs, which are easier to automatically detect and verify. In this work, we overcome this limitation by using large language models (LLMs), which have been demonstrated to be adept at natural language processing and code generation. By prompti...

  - **Abstract**: Many automated test generation techniques have been developed to aid developers with writing tests. To facilitate full automation, most existing techniques aim to either increase coverage, or generate exploratory inputs. However, existing test generation techniques largely fall short of achieving more semantic objectives, such as generating tests to reproduce a given bug report. Reproducing bugs is nonetheless important, as our empirical study shows that the number of tests added in open source ...

  - **Abstract**: Flaky tests, characterized by inconsistent results across repeated executions, present significant challenges in software testing, especially during regression testing. Recently, there has been emerging research interest in non-idempotentoutcome (NIO) flaky tests-tests that pass on the initial run but fail on subsequent executions within the same environment. Despite progress in utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) to address flaky tests, existing methods have not tackled NIO flaky tests. The ...

  - **Abstract**: Failure reproduction is a crucial step for debugging software systems, but it is often challenging and time-consuming, especially when the failures are caused by complex inputs, states, or environments. In this paper, we present ReproCopilot, a tool that leverages program analysis and a large language model (LLM) to generate a workload (i.e., code and inputs) that can reproduce a given failure. ReproCopilot proposes two novel techniques: state-oriented code generation and dynamic refinement. The...

Researchers have shown that LLM agents can exploit real-world vulnerabilities when given a description of the vulnerability and toy capture-the-flag problems. However, these agents still perform poorly on real-world vulnerabilities that are unknown to the agent ahead of time (zero-day vulnerabilities). In this work, we show that teams of LLM agents can exploit real-world, zero-day vulnerabilities. Prior ...
