- [Tratto: A Neuro-Symbolic Approach to Deriving Axiomatic Test Oracles](../venues/ISSTA2025/paper_28.md), ([ISSTA2025](../venues/ISSTA2025/README.md))

  - **Abstract**: This paper presents Tratto, a neuro-symbolic approach that generates assertions (boolean expressions) that can serve as axiomatic oracles, from source code and documentation. The symbolic module of Tratto takes advantage of the grammar of the programming language, the unit under test, and the context of the unit (its class and available APIs) to restrict the search space of the tokens that can be successfully used to generate valid oracles. The neural module of Tratto uses transformers fine-tune...

  - **Abstract**: The ability to execute the test suite of a project is essential in many scenarios, e.g., to assess code quality and code coverage, to validate code changes made by developers or automated tools, and to ensure compatibility with dependencies. Despite its importance, executing the test suite of a project can be challenging in practice because different projects use different programming languages, software ecosystems, build systems, testing frameworks, and other tools. These challenges make it dif...

  - **Abstract**: Many popular programming languages, including C#, Java, and Python, support exceptions. Exceptions are thrown during program execution if an unwanted event happens, e.g., a method is invoked with an illegal argument value. Software developers write exceptional behavior tests (EBTs) to check that their code detects unwanted events and throws appropriate exceptions. Prior research studies have shown the importance of EBTs, but those studies also highlighted that developers put most of their effort...

  - **Abstract**: Search-based software testing (SBST) generates high-coverage test cases for programs under test with a combination of test case generation and mutation. SBST's performance relies on there being a reasonable probability of generating test cases that exercise the core logic of the program under test. Given such test cases, SBST can then explore the space around them to exercise various parts of the program. This paper explores whether Large Language Models (LLMs) of code, such as OpenAI's Codex, c...

  - **Abstract**: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized language processing, but face critical challenges with security, privacy, and generating hallucinations — coherent but factually inaccurate outputs. A major issue is fact-conflicting hallucination (FCH), where LLMs produce content contradicting ground truth facts. Addressing FCH is difficult due to two key challenges: 1) Automatically constructing and updating benchmark datasets is hard, as existing methods rely on manually curated static benchmar...

  - **Abstract**: Fuzzing has achieved tremendous success in discovering bugs and vulnerabilities in various software systems. Systems under test (SUTs) that take in programming or formal language as inputs, e.g., compilers, runtime engines, constraint solvers, and software libraries with accessible APIs, are especially important as they are fundamental building blocks of software development. However, existing fuzzers for such systems often target a specific language, and thus cannot be easily applied to other l...

However, there are still syscalls rarely or not covered (called low frequency syscalls, LFS) in a period of fuzzing, meaning the relevant code branches remain unexplored. This is due to the complex dependencies of the LFS and mutation uncertainty, which makes it difficult for fuzzers to generate corresponding syscall sequences.

  - **Abstract**: How to find security flaws in a protocol implementation without a machine-readable specification of the protocol? Facing the internet, protocol implementations are particularly security-critical software systems where inputs must adhere to a specific structure and order that is often informally specified in hundreds of pages in natural language (RFC). Without some machine-readable version of that protocol, it is difficult to automatically generate valid test inputs for its implementation that fo...

## Mutation Testing

- [LLMorpheus: Mutation Testing using Large Language Models](../venues/arXiv2024/paper_29.md), ([arXiv2024](../venues/arXiv2024/README.md))

  - **Abstract**: In mutation testing, the quality of a test suite is evaluated by introducing faults into a program and determining whether the program's tests detect them. Most existing approaches for mutation testing involve the application of a fixed set of mutation operators, e.g., replacing a "+" with a "-" or removing a function's body. However, certain types of real-world bugs cannot easily be simulated by such approaches, limiting their effectiveness. This paper presents a technique where a Large Languag...

- [From Naptime to Big Sleep: Using Large Language Models To Catch Vulnerabilities In Real-World Code](../venues/Google2024/paper_1.md), ([Google2024](../venues/Google2024/README.md))

  - **Abstract**: In our previous post, Project Naptime: Evaluating Offensive Security Capabilities of Large Language Models, we introduced our framework for large-language-model-assisted vulnerability research and demonstrated its potential by improving the state-of-the-art performance on Meta's CyberSecEval2 benchmarks. Since then, Naptime has evolved into Big Sleep, a collaboration between Google Project Zero and Google DeepMind....

- [Interactive Tools Substantially Assist LM Agents in Finding Security Vulnerabilities](../venues/arXiv2025/paper_18.md), ([arXiv2025](../venues/arXiv2025/README.md))

  - **Abstract**: Although language model (LM) agents have demonstrated increased performance in multiple domains, including coding and web-browsing, their success in cybersecurity has been limited. We present EnIGMA, an LM agent for autonomously solving Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges. We introduce new tools and interfaces to improve the agent's ability to find and exploit security vulnerabilities, focusing on interactive terminal programs. These novel Interactive Agent Tools enable LM agents, for the first ti...

- [Language agents as hackers: Evaluating cybersecurity skills with capture the flag](../venues/NeurIPS2023/paper_1.md), ([NeurIPS2023](../venues/NeurIPS2023/README.md))

  - **Abstract**: Amidst the advent of language models (LMs) and their wide-ranging capabilities, concerns have been raised about their implications with regards to privacy and security. In particular, the emergence of language agents as a promising aid for automating and augmenting digital work poses immediate questions concerning their misuse as malicious cybersecurity actors. With their exceptional compute efficiency and execution speed relative to human counterparts, language agents may be extremely adept at ...

- [Teams of LLM Agents can Exploit Zero-Day Vulnerabilities](../venues/arXiv2024/paper_30.md), ([arXiv2024](../venues/arXiv2024/README.md))

  - **Abstract**: LLM agents have become increasingly sophisticated, especially in the realm of cybersecurity. Researchers have shown that LLM agents can exploit real-world vulnerabilities when given a description of the vulnerability and toy capture-the-flag problems. However, these agents still perform poorly on real-world vulnerabilities that are unknown to the agent ahead of time (zero-day vulnerabilities). In this work, we show that teams of LLM agents can exploit real-world, zero-day vulnerabilities. Prior ...

  - **Abstract**: The widespread application of large language models (LLMs) underscores the importance of deep learning (DL) technologies that rely on foundational DL libraries such as PyTorch and TensorFlow. Despite their robust features, these libraries face challenges with scalability and adaptation to rapid advancements in the LLM community. In response, tech giants like Apple and Huawei are developing their own DL libraries to enhance performance, increase scalability, and safeguard intellectual property. E...

  - **Abstract**: Today, we introduce [Vulnhuntr](https://github.com/protectai/vulnhuntr), a Python static code analyzer that leverages the power of large language models (LLMs) to find and explain complex, multistep vulnerabilities. Thanks to the capabilities of models like Claude 3.5, AI has now uncovered more than a dozen remotely exploitable 0-day vulnerabilities targeting open-source projects in the AI ecosystem with over 10,000 GitHub stars in just a few hours of running it. These discoveries include full-b...
