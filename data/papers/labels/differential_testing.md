- [DiffSpec: Differential Testing with LLMs using Natural Language Specifications and Code Artifacts](../venues/arXiv2024/paper_23.md), ([arXiv2024](../venues/arXiv2024/README.md))

  - **Abstract**: Differential testing can be an effective way to find bugs in software systems with multiple implementations that conform to the same specification, like compilers, network protocol parsers, and language runtimes. Specifications for such systems are often standardized in natural language documents, like Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) specifications, Wasm specifications or IETF RFC's. Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated potential in both generating tests and handling large volumes o...

- [METAMON: Finding Inconsistencies between Program Documentation and Behavior using Metamorphic LLM Queries](../venues/LLM4Code2025/paper_1.md), ([LLM4Code2025](../venues/LLM4Code2025/README.md))

  - **Abstract**: Code documentation can, if written precisely, help developers better understand the code they accompany. However, unlike code, code documentation cannot be automatically verified via execution, potentially leading to inconsistencies between documentation and the actual behavior. While such inconsistencies can harmful for developer’s understanding of the code, checking and finding them remains a costly task due to the involvement of human engineers. This paper proposes METAMON, which uses an exis...

- [Nuances are the Key: Unlocking ChatGPT to Find Failure-Inducing Tests with Differential Prompting](../venues/ASE2023/paper_7.md), ([ASE2023](../venues/ASE2023/README.md))

  - **Abstract**: Automated detection of software failures is an important but challenging software engineering task. It involves finding in a vast search space the failure-inducing test cases that contain an input triggering the software fault and an oracle asserting the incorrect execution. We are motivated to study how far this outstanding challenge can be solved by recent advances in large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT. However, our study reveals that ChatGPT has a relatively low success rate (28.8%)...
