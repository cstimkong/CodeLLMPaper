- [BountyBench: Dollar Impact of AI Agent Attackers and Defenders on Real-World Cybersecurity Systems](../venues/arXiv2025/paper_20.md), ([arXiv2025](../venues/arXiv2025/README.md))

  - **Abstract**: AI agents have the potential to significantly alter the cybersecurity landscape. To help us understand this change, we introduce the first framework to capture offensive and defensive cyber-capabilities in evolving real-world systems. Instantiating this framework with BountyBench, we set up 25 systems with complex, real-world codebases. To capture the vulnerability lifecycle, we define three task types: Detect (detecting a new vulnerability), Exploit (exploiting a specific vulnerability), and Pa...

- [CVE-Bench: A Benchmark for AI Agents' Ability to Exploit Real-World Web Application Vulnerabilities](../venues/ICML2025/paper_3.md), ([ICML2025](../venues/ICML2025/README.md))

  - **Abstract**: Large language model (LLM) agents are increasingly capable of autonomously conducting cyberattacks, posing significant threats to existing applications. This growing risk highlights the urgent need for a real-world benchmark to evaluate the ability of LLM agents to exploit web application vulnerabilities. However, existing benchmarks fall short as they are limited to abstracted Capture the Flag competitions or lack comprehensive coverage. Building a benchmark for real-world vulnerabilities invol...

- [Cybench: A Framework for Evaluating Cybersecurity Capabilities and Risks of Language Models](../venues/arXiv2024/paper_32.md), ([arXiv2024](../venues/arXiv2024/README.md))

  - **Abstract**: Language Model (LM) agents for cybersecurity that are capable of autonomously identifying vulnerabilities and executing exploits have the potential to cause real-world impact. Policymakers, model providers, and other researchers in the AI and cybersecurity communities are interested in quantifying the capabilities of such agents to help mitigate cyberrisk and investigate opportunities for penetration testing. Toward that end, we introduce Cybench, a framework for specifying cybersecurity tasks a...

- [CyberGym: Evaluating AI Agents' Cybersecurity Capabilities with Real-World Vulnerabilities at Scale](../venues/arXiv2025/paper_19.md), ([arXiv2025](../venues/arXiv2025/README.md))

  - **Abstract**: Large language model (LLM) agents are becoming increasingly skilled at handling cybersecurity tasks autonomously. Thoroughly assessing their cybersecurity capabilities is critical and urgent, given the high stakes in this domain. However, existing benchmarks fall short, often failing to capture real-world scenarios or being limited in scope. To address this gap, we introduce CyberGym, a large-scale and high-quality cybersecurity evaluation framework featuring 1,507 real-world vulnerabilities fou...

- [From Naptime to Big Sleep: Using Large Language Models To Catch Vulnerabilities In Real-World Code](../venues/Google2024/paper_1.md), ([Google2024](../venues/Google2024/README.md))

  - **Abstract**: In our previous post, Project Naptime: Evaluating Offensive Security Capabilities of Large Language Models, we introduced our framework for large-language-model-assisted vulnerability research and demonstrated its potential by improving the state-of-the-art performance on Meta's CyberSecEval2 benchmarks. Since then, Naptime has evolved into Big Sleep, a collaboration between Google Project Zero and Google DeepMind....

- [Interactive Tools Substantially Assist LM Agents in Finding Security Vulnerabilities](../venues/arXiv2025/paper_18.md), ([arXiv2025](../venues/arXiv2025/README.md))

  - **Abstract**: Although language model (LM) agents have demonstrated increased performance in multiple domains, including coding and web-browsing, their success in cybersecurity has been limited. We present EnIGMA, an LM agent for autonomously solving Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges. We introduce new tools and interfaces to improve the agent's ability to find and exploit security vulnerabilities, focusing on interactive terminal programs. These novel Interactive Agent Tools enable LM agents, for the first ti...

- [Language agents as hackers: Evaluating cybersecurity skills with capture the flag](../venues/NeurIPS2023/paper_1.md), ([NeurIPS2023](../venues/NeurIPS2023/README.md))

  - **Abstract**: Amidst the advent of language models (LMs) and their wide-ranging capabilities, concerns have been raised about their implications with regards to privacy and security. In particular, the emergence of language agents as a promising aid for automating and augmenting digital work poses immediate questions concerning their misuse as malicious cybersecurity actors. With their exceptional compute efficiency and execution speed relative to human counterparts, language agents may be extremely adept at ...

- [Teams of LLM Agents can Exploit Zero-Day Vulnerabilities](../venues/arXiv2024/paper_31.md), ([arXiv2024](../venues/arXiv2024/README.md))

  - **Abstract**: LLM agents have become increasingly sophisticated, especially in the realm of cybersecurity. Researchers have shown that LLM agents can exploit real-world vulnerabilities when given a description of the vulnerability and toy capture-the-flag problems. However, these agents still perform poorly on real-world vulnerabilities that are unknown to the agent ahead of time (zero-day vulnerabilities). In this work, we show that teams of LLM agents can exploit real-world, zero-day vulnerabilities. Prior ...

  - **Abstract**: The widespread application of large language models (LLMs) underscores the importance of deep learning (DL) technologies that rely on foundational DL libraries such as PyTorch and TensorFlow. Despite their robust features, these libraries face challenges with scalability and adaptation to rapid advancements in the LLM community. In response, tech giants like Apple and Huawei are developing their own DL libraries to enhance performance, increase scalability, and safeguard intellectual property. E...
